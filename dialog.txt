#suit
Wizard: Well, look at you! What a shiny suit of armor you've got there!
Player: This isn't armor; it's just a suit! I had an important meeting!
Wizard: A suit? How delightful! It looks quite formidable. Ready to battle a dragon at a grand gathering?
Player: More like trying to impress some folks at a gathering, but I see your point!

#casual clothes
Wizard: By the stars! What in the realm are you wearing? It looks... comfortable?
Player: This? It's just a casual outfit! Perfect for hanging out or running errands.
Wizard: Casual outfit? How delightful! I’ve never seen such garments. Are they woven from the finest dragon scales?
Player: Nope! Just cotton. No dragons involved, I promise.
Wizard: A gathering, you say? A cunning foe indeed! But tell me, does it offer any protection against fireballs? I hope so because you'll need it

#bathing suit
Wizard: By the stars! Is that what passes for clothing where you come from?
Player: This? It's a bathing suit! Perfect for a beach day!
Wizard: A bathing suit? Fascinating! So, in your world, you don’t like wearing clothes?
Player: Well, we do, just not when we’re swimming or lounging. It's comfortable!
Wizard: Comfortable, you say? Here, you'd catch the eye of every ogre in the forest!
Player: Ogres? Yikes! I didn't think about that!
Wizard: Yes, they'd probably think you’re a snack. A very unusual snack.
Player: So, what's the dress code here?
Wizard: Layers, my friend! A good robe, sturdy boots, and perhaps a hat to ward off prying eyes!
Player: I guess I'll need a whole new wardrobe, then.

#robe
Wizard: Well, well! Look at you in that splendid robe! Are you a wizard from some far-off land?
Player: Uh, this? It's just a bathrobe. I was having a lazy day!
Wizard: A bathrobe? Fascinating! I’ve never seen such a stylish wizarding garment. Where do you hail from?
Player: I'm from a place where we wear these for comfort, not magic. No spells here, just snacks!
Wizard: *under breath* They are never going to make it out of here.

#no teethbrushed and ate an onion
Wizard: Excuse me, but have you eaten an orc recently? Your breath could knock a dragon out!
Player: What? No! I just had an onion. But now that you mention it, how does orc taste?
Wizard: Well, it's a bit... gamey. A real acquired taste, I assure you!

#no shower
Wizard: Good heavens! What is that smell? Did you forget to shower, or are trolls nearby?
Player: Uh, I might've skipped a few baths. But trolls? Really?
Wizard: Trust me, if trolls can smell you from a mile away, we're in trouble!

Wizard: Oh, they're attracted to smells, too! And right now, you’re like bacon!

#wake up 1
You awaken to the sun beams coming through your bedside window. "Another day, another dollar," You think as you shift your 
legs to get out of bed, and start walking to the kitchen.

#running late
You glance at the clock, and realize you are running very late for work!

#quickly
Thankfully your work is close enough to walk, but you know you need to run! There is some contruction down the road but
you don't think much of it as you sprint through it. Before you get pass the contruction, you hear someone yell, 
"HEY! LOOK OUT!" It was too late. You feel a sharp pain on you head as your crushed by debris.

#wake up 2
You awaken in a field of grass as a man with a staff approaches you. He is wearing a floppy hat and blue robes. He looks
like what you remember Gandalf from Lord of the Rings to look like.

Wizard: How are you unwounded? I saw you fall from the sky. 
Player: I don't know? One minute, I was walking to work, and the next thing I know I'm waking up here!

#story of land 1
In the land of Zonia, a realm of vibrant forests, majestic mountains, dark marshes,  and ancient magic, there existed a 
prophecy whispered among the wise and old. It foretold the arrival of an Outsider, one who would bring a new light 
to the realm and save the captured princess from Gorlath the giant Slime King.
Long ago, the land thrived in harmony, but darkness had begun to seep into the hearts of its inhabitants. The once-
peaceful creatures of the forest turned hostile, the skies darkened, Gorlath rose to power, and fear reigned in the 
hearts of the people. The Council of Elders, a gathering of the wisest beings in Zonia, sought answers in the ancient 
texts and discovered the prophecy. It spoke of a traveler from another world who would arrive dressed in strange
garments, wielding untapped potential and courage. This Outsider would embark on a quest to restore the fractured 
bonds of Zonia and return home.

#story of land 2
Your journey starts in the quaint town of Willow Brooke, nestled between lush, green hills and crystal-clear streams. 
Known for its vibrant markets and friendly townsfolk, Willow Brooke was a hub of trade and a melting pot of cultures. 
The townspeople truly believe in the Outsider's arrival, their hearts still full of hope and anticipation.
After Willow Brooke you must travel to Valley of Whispers, a lush, fertile expanse filled with vibrant and aggressive  
flora and hidden dangers. As you venture deeper into the valley, you hear the soft rustling of leaves and the faint 
murmurs of ancient spirits. The valley is known for its enchanted winds that carry voices from the past, testing the 
resolve of travelers.

#story of land 3
To pass through, you must confront the Echoing Spirits, lost souls who seek to entrap wanderers in their tales of 
despair. They will challenge you with riddles and stories, probing your heart to see if you are worthy. 
After emerging from the Valley of Whispers, you ascend the the Stormspire Heights, a towering range of mountains 
that seem to scrape the very sky. The air here is thin, and the paths are treacherous. As you climb, the beauty of the 
landscape you are met with perilous cliffs and sudden storms that can sweep you off your feet.
The peaks are guarded by the Stormspire Sentinels, majestic beings made of stone and cloud. They will test your 
strength and determination. To proceed, you must complete a trial of endurance, scaling the cliffs while overcoming 
fierce winds and illusions that threaten to lead you astray. 

#story of land 4
Finally, you arrive at the Dark Marsh, a foreboding expanse shrouded in mist and mystery. The ground is soft and 
treacherous, with hidden sinkholes and lurking shadows. The air is thick with an eerie silence, occasionally broken by 
distant croaks and rustles that send shivers down your spine.
It is here that the final challenge awaits you. Gorlath the Slime King, the malevolent entity that has been spreading 
fear throughout Zonia. To face this powerful foe, you must navigate the twisting paths of the marsh while battling 
your own fears and doubts, which manifest as shadowy creatures drawn from the darkness.
You must rally your courage and confront your own inner darkness. The battle will be fierce, but with the light of 
hope and the strength of your journey behind you, you can defeat Gorlath ,restore peace to Zonia, and return home.
