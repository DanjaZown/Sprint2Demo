#suit
Wizard: Well, look at you! What a shiny suit of armor you've got there!
Player: This isn't armor; it's just a suit! I had an important meeting!
Wizard: A suit? How delightful! It looks quite formidable. Ready to battle a dragon at a grand gathering?
Player: More like trying to impress some folks at a gathering, but I see your point!

#casual clothes
Wizard: By the stars! What in the realm are you wearing? It looks... comfortable?
Player: This? It's just a casual outfit! Perfect for hanging out or running errands.
Wizard: Casual outfit? How delightful! I’ve never seen such garments. Are they woven from the finest dragon scales?
Player: Nope! Just cotton. No dragons involved, I promise.
Wizard: A gathering, you say? A cunning foe indeed! But tell me, does it offer any protection against fireballs? I hope so because you'll need it

#bathing suit
Wizard: By the stars! Is that what passes for clothing where you come from?
Player: This? It's a bathing suit! Perfect for a beach day!
Wizard: A bathing suit? Fascinating! So, in your world, you don’t like wearing clothes?
Player: Well, we do, just not when we’re swimming or lounging. It's comfortable!
Wizard: Comfortable, you say? Here, you'd catch the eye of every ogre in the forest!
Player: Ogres? Yikes! I didn't think about that!
Wizard: Yes, they'd probably think you’re a snack. A very unusual snack.
Player: So, what's the dress code here?
Wizard: Layers, my friend! A good robe, sturdy boots, and perhaps a hat to ward off prying eyes!
Player: I guess I'll need a whole new wardrobe, then.

#robe
Wizard: Well, well! Look at you in that splendid robe! Are you a wizard from some far-off land?
Player: Uh, this? It's just a bathrobe. I was having a lazy day!
Wizard: A bathrobe? Fascinating! I’ve never seen such a stylish wizarding garment. Where do you hail from?
Player: I'm from a place where we wear these for comfort, not magic. No spells here, just snacks!
Wizard: *under breath* They are never going to make it out of here.

Everything fades to black.  
You wake up next to the wizard again.

#Dialog
Wizard: We must get you to an inn and get you a proper bath.

#no teethbrushed and ate an onion
Wizard: Excuse me, but have you eaten an orc recently? Your breath could knock a dragon out!
Player: What? No! I just had an onion. But now that you mention it, how does orc taste?
Wizard: Well, it's a bit... gamey. A real acquired taste, I assure you!

#no shower
Wizard: Good heavens! What is that smell? Did you forget to shower, or are trolls nearby?
Player: Uh, I might've skipped a few baths. But trolls? Really?
Wizard: Trust me, if trolls can smell you from a mile away, we're in trouble!
Player: I thought they were attracted to shiny things, not... whatever this is!
Wizard: Oh, they're attracted to smells, too! And right now, you’re like bacon!
